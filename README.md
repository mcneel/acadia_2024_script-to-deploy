# Scripting in Practice: from script to deploy
A workshop presented on Monday, November 11, 2024 at Acadia in Calgary, Canada

This workshop will introduce the Code Editor in Rhino 8 - a new framework designed for user-friendly tool development and deployment). Using a real-life industry case study from an architectural practice, we'll guide you through identifying a suite of tools that streamline project deliverables, with a particular focus on documentation and geometry attributes. The goal of the workshop is to equip you with the skills to integrate these tools as a plugin, easily shareable across teams. We will kick off with an overview of the new Code Editor, followed by hands-on development of tools in Python, C#, and Grasshopper definitions. You will learn how to use Script Editor to package these tools into a Rhino toolbar and deploy them as plugins using Rhino’s Package Manager. We will also go through version control system and enabling automated deployments through continuous integration.​​
